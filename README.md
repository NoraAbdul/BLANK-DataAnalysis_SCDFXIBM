# BLANK-DataAnalysis_SCDFXIBM

**Short Description**

Fake news is normally spread through the sharing of post on social media such as Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp etc. 
Our team will be able to retrieve the data through a custom search engine that will be able to search related news by keywords. 
Hence, related websites will be shown through the next following page. There will be indication that the related sites are fake or not. Multiple news outlets and trusted journalist sites act as trusted sites to build a pyramid structure where non-trusted sites are at the bottom and trusted sites are at the top. Hence, when a number of sites are repeating the same info not included in the trusted sites, we can be notified vice versa if in case trusted sites only have 1 mention unlike other sites.
With this idea, our team will be focusing on news in relations to SCDF as there are a number of websites (credible and non-credible sources) with relation to a specific news or updates related to SCDF. This system will be accessible through an application that users can download in their android or ios smartphone.

**The architecture of our proposed solution**
![SolutionArhitecture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85574822/121530902-7da2e300-ca30-11eb-8972-e741b0713dc9.JPG)




**How our application will work.**

These group of websites will be transmitted to the web server. 
Then the web server will submit a database request (keywords or question) to our database server via SQL with python. 
This will then prompt a database reply back to the web server with the results with SQL as well. 
Hence the web server will send the files, via PHP server processing, that can be in html, jpg, css or js to the browser displays page. 
This will be show web browsers of the relevant search. The fake news will be indicated in the display




**Roadmap**
We will need to use SQL with Python to create the database and ensuring its able to be use in phone apps. PHP and MySQL will be use to create a custom search engine.
