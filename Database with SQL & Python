### First, we need to create a database to store the data. This can be done viua SQL which enable quick retrieval of data from database. 


Limitations and Restrictions
A maximum of 32,767 databases can be specified on an instance of SQL Server.

Prerequisites
The CREATE DATABASE statement must run in autocommit mode (the default transaction management mode) and is not allowed in an explicit or implicit transaction.

Recommendations
- The master database should be backed up whenever a user database is created, modified, or dropped.
- When you create a database, make the data files as large as possible based on the maximum amount of data you expect in the database.

Security - Permissions
- Requires CREATE DATABASE permission in the master database, or requires CREATE ANY DATABASE, or ALTER ANY DATABASE permission.
- To maintain control over disk use on an instance of SQL Server, permission to create databases is typically limited to a few login accounts.






To create a database 
- Using Transact-SQL

1. Connect to the Database Engine.
2. From the Standard bar, click New Query.
3. Copy and paste the following example into the query window and click Execute. This example creates the database Sales. Because the keyword PRIMARY is not used, the first file (Sales_dat) becomes the primary file. Because neither MB nor KB is specified in the SIZE parameter for the Sales_dat file, it uses MB and is allocated in megabytes. The Sales_log file is allocated in megabytes because the MB suffix is explicitly stated in the SIZE parameter.

USE master ;  
GO  
CREATE DATABASE Sales  
ON   
( NAME = Sales_dat,  
    FILENAME = 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL13.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\DATA\saledat.mdf',  
    SIZE = 10,  
    MAXSIZE = 50,  
    FILEGROWTH = 5 )  
LOG ON  
( NAME = Sales_log,  
    FILENAME = 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL13.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\DATA\salelog.ldf',  
    SIZE = 5MB,  
    MAXSIZE = 25MB,  
    FILEGROWTH = 5MB ) ;  
GO




To be able to operate our system in an application, we need to create and manipulate SQL databases with Python

For Python and SQL to communicate with each other.

- We need to install the MySQL Connector Python library. 
use pip:
    pip install mysql-connector-python

- We are also going to be using pandas.
pip install pandas



# Importing Libraries

import mysql.connector
from mysql.connector import Error
import pandas as pd

# Connecting to MySQL Server

def create_server_connection(host_name, user_name, user_password):
    connection = None
    try:
        connection = mysql.connector.connect(
            host=host_name,
            user=user_name,
            passwd=user_password
        )
        print("MySQL Database connection successful")
    except Error as err:
        print(f"Error: '{err}'")

    return connection
    
    
    
  
  
 # To create a database 
 
    def create_database(connection, query):
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query)
        print("Database created successfully")
    except Error as err:
        print(f"Error: '{err}'")

mysql>

define a query to create the database and call the function:

create_database_query = "CREATE DATABASE SCDF"
create_database(connection, create_database_query) 


# However, our database will store websites of specific news in relation of SCDF that can be from credible or non-credible sources.
